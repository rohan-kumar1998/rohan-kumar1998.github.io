      <p class="paracont">Patna is the capital of the Indian state of Bihar, and one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world. The Buddhist, Hindu and Jain pilgrim centres of Vaishali, Rajgir (or Rajgriha), Nalanda, Bodhgaya and Pawapuri are nearby and Patna is also a sacred city for Sikhs (the tenth and last "human" guru, Guru Gobind Singh, was born here).
        Patna is located on the south bank of the Ganges River, called Ganga locally. Patna has a very long riverline, and it is surrounded on three sides by rivers—the Ganga, Sone, and Poonpun (also spelt Punpun). Just to the north of Patna across the river Ganga flows the river Gandak making it a unique place having four largish rivers in its vicinity. It is the largest riverine city in the world. A historical city on the banks of Ganges was nomenclated by princess Sarika, daughter of king Patliputra. The city is approximately 25 km long and 9 km to 10 km wide. The bridge over the river Ganga, named after Mahatma Gandhi, is 5850 m long is said to be the longest single river bridge in the world. The walled old area, called Patna City by the locals, is also a major trading centre.
        Though geographically located in the Magadh region of Bihar, many residents of Patna are natives of one of the four other regions of Bihar -Bhojpur, Mithila, Vajj and Ang, which differ only slightly from each other. Intermarriages and cultural intermixing among the people of the five regions has been so common that it may be difficult for an outsider to discern the differences. Intermixing of people is also common at the village level (e.g. resident of Gulni include people from Gaya, Ganga-par and other villages).
<br>
Family orientation in Patna : People are religious and family-oriented, and their lives are deeply rooted in tradition. The interests of the family take precedence over that of an individual. Families are generally large, though the government is actively encouraging family planning to curb rapid population growth. Extended families often live together in one home because of economic necessity. Although the culture is same among the regions, the dialects spoken are quite different. Many talented people of Bihar have emigrated for better opportunities  
        Staple food "Khichdi", the broth of rice and lentils, seasoned with spices, and served with several accompanying items like curd, chutney, pickles, papads, ghee (clarified butter) and chokha (boiled mashed potatoes, seasoned with finely cut onions, green chilies) constitutes the lunch for most Patnaites on Saturdays.
<br>
Patna is also known for the sweet delicacies of central Bihar including Khaja, Motichoor ka Ladoo, Kala Jamun, Kesaria Peda, Parwal ki Mithai, Khubi ka Lai and Chena Murki. These owe their origin to towns in the vicinity of Patna: Khaja from Silao, Ladoo from Maner, Kala Jamun from Vikram, Khubi ka Lai from Barh, Kesaria Peda from Gaya and Chena Murki from Koelwar, Poori from Behea. Descendants of the original family members of the cooks, called halwais in the local language, have migrated to urban Patna and authentic sweet delicacies are now available in the city itself. Unlike the Bengali sweets which are soaked in syrup of sugar and are therefore wet, sweets of Patna and Bihar are mostly dry. The mangoes of Digha, Patna are very delicious & famous.

      <h3> History of Patna :</h3>
      Name of Patna : There are several theories regarding the source of the appellation Patna:

It is etymologically derived from Patan, the name of the Hindu goddess, Patan Devi.
It comes from Pattan (meaning "port" in Sanskrit), since the city, located near the confluence of four rivers, has been a thriving river port. 
It may be a short form of Patliputra, one of the most ancient names of this city. This name was mentioned by Megasthenes (350 BCE-290 BCE), the Greek historian, (calling it 'Palibothra' or 'Palimbotra', in his writings during the 4th century, and also appears in the records of the Chinese traveller, Fa Hien. 
The city has been known by various names during its more than two millennia long existence — Pataligram, Pataliputra, Kusumpur, Pushpapura, Azimabad and the present-day Patna. Patna received its current name during the reign of Sher Shah Suri, whose tomb is at Sasaram, a place near Patna.
      <br>
      Legend ascribes the origin of Patna to a mythological King Putraka who created Patna by magic for his queen Patali, literally Trumpet flower, which gives it its ancient name Pataligrama. It is said that in honour of the first born to the queen, the city was named Pataliputra. Gram is the Sanskrit for village and Putra means son.
      <br>
      Patna From a scientific history perspective, it would be appropriate to surmise that the history of Patna started around the year 490 BC when Ajatashatru, the king of Magadh, wanted to shift his capital from the hilly Rajagriha to a more strategically located place to combat the Licchavis of Vaishali. He chose the site on the bank of Ganges and fortified the area. From that time, the city has had a continuous history, a record claimed by few cities in the world. Gautam Buddha passed through this place in the last year of his life, and he had prophesized a great future for this place, but at the same time, he predicted its ruin from flood, fire, and feud.
      <br>
      With the rise of the Mauryan empire, the place became the seat of power and nerve centre of the sub-continent. From Pataliputra, the famed emperor Chandragupta Maurya (a contemporary of Alexander) ruled a vast empire, stretching from the Bay of Bengal to Afghanistan.

Early Mauryan Patliputra was mostly built with wooden structures. Emperor Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, transformed the wooden capital into a stone construction around 273 BC. Chinese scholar Fa Hein, who visited India sometime around A.D. 399-414, has given a vivid description of the stone structures in his travelogue.

Megasthenes (350 BCE-290 BCE), Greek historian and ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya, gives the first written account of Patliputra. In his book Indika, he mentions that the city of Palibothra (Pataliputra, modern day Patna) was situated on the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Arennovoas (Sonabhadra - Hiranyawah) and was 9 miles (14 km) long and 1.75 miles (2.82 km) wide.
       <h3>Festivals :</h3>
      Patna is very secular - like religiously so. An amazing number of festivals are celebrated here with pomp and show. The major ones are Holi and Chhath, although Diwali and Dussehra also cause equal fervor among the junta. Eid and Christmas used to be desolate affairs some decades back, but the residents are taking to these with renewed vigor of late.
<br>
Patnaites swear by Chhath. For any Bihari, the importance of this festival is paramount. Like Mumbai's Ganesh Chaturthi, Kolkata's Durga Puja, Lucknow's Eid and Goa's Christman, Patna's Chhath does not have any rival. The Ganges gets drowned in a sea of crimson saris, and the moment is unparalleled.
 <br>     Holi has its own flavor in Patna. Forget henna colors and pichkaris, here you will be smeared in mud and hurled into gutters. The clothes will be ripped off you, and if you are lucky, your underwear may be spared. It's all in good humor, though.
  <br>    Having done my schooling from the city, the sheer number of festivals also meant an added number of holidays, which is why I used to love every festival, from Mahavir Jayanti to Good Friday. Also, while my friends in other cities had a 2-day Diwali, we got a week-plus-long Diwali-cum-Chhath break.
